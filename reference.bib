  abstract = "Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which offer systematic
              representations of causal relationships, have become an
              established framework for the analysis of causal inference in
              epidemiology, often being used to determine covariate adjustment
              sets for minimizing confounding bias. DAGitty is a popular web
              application for drawing and analysing DAGs. Here we introduce the
              R package 'dagitty', which provides access to all of the
              capabilities of the DAGitty web application within the R platform
              for statistical computing, and also offers several new functions.
              We describe how the R package 'dagitty' can be used to: evaluate
              whether a DAG is consistent with the dataset it is intended to
              represent; enumerate 'statistically equivalent' but causally
              different DAGs; and identify exposure-outcome adjustment sets
              that are valid for causally different but statistically
              equivalent DAGs. This functionality enables epidemiologists to
              detect causal misspecifications in DAGs and make robust
              inferences that remain valid for a range of different DAGs. The R
              package 'dagitty' is available through the comprehensive R
              archive network (CRAN) at
              [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dagitty/]. The source
              code is available on github at
              [https://github.com/jtextor/dagitty]. The web application
              'DAGitty' is free software, licensed under the GNU general public
              licence (GPL) version 2 and is available at
              [http://dagitty.net/].",

               questions as basic as ``Does this treatment harm or help
               patients?'' But though hundreds of introductory texts are

               Inference in Statistics fills that gap. Using simple examples
               and plain language, the book lays out how to define causal
               parameters; the assumptions necessary to estimate causal
               parameters in a variety of situations; how to express those
               assumptions mathematically; whether those assumptions have
